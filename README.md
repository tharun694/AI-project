# Veritas AI Project

This project was developed as part of the **Veritas AI** program and demonstrates a full-stack AI application, with separate **frontend** and **backend** components.

---

##  Project Overview

- **Frontend**: User interface allowing interaction with the AI model, built with HTML/CSS/JavaScript (or your chosen framework/library).
- **Backend**: AI model logic and API endpoint(s) implemented using react.js.
